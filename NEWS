restorepoint 0.12
-----------------

* 2013-07-23
* Changed order of arguments in restore.point, to.global is now second argument (thanks to Liviu Andronic for the suggestion)
* Added a simple function assert to check code via assertions
* Allow to set deep.copy globally as a restore.point.option 

restorepoint 0.11
-----------------

* In the restorepoint console, the restored variables will be directly copied into the local environment in which expressions are evaluated. Before they were just copied into an enclosing environment. One effect: ls() shows now also the restored variables.
